My name is Tim Moor and I am a fully time DevOps and Open Source Evangalist. I've worked for Red Hat as part of the professional services arm and throghouly enjoyed my time traveling the world seeing the various ways people use Open Source software. 

So I guess you hear to find out a bit more about "Who I am", "Why I write the posts that I do" and just gernally being nosiey I guess.
